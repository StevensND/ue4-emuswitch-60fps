## Game Info

**Title: OCTOPATH TRAVELER 0**

**TitleID: 01005270232F2000**

**Motor Engine**: Unreal Engine 5.4.2

This game has changed the way I used to make mods for games with the Unreal Engine graphics engine, which is why it has taken me longer.

It's the first game I've played and tested where this has happened.. You will notice this if you read the .pchtxt file.

Also thanks to [Fl4sh](https://github.com/Fl4sh9174) for the help modding this game. 

## Mods Available

- **60FPS**
- **Uncap FPS**
- **Disable DOF**
- **Resolution**: 1920x1080, 2560x1440, 3840x2160

> [!NOTE]
The Default resolution on **Docked** it's **1280x720**.

It should be 1920x1080 but the game applies a screen percentage of 66.66 %. This drops the resolution to 1280x720.

> [!NOTE]
DOF means Depth of Field. I leave this note due to some random YouTubers don't remember this.

## Versions supported

- **1.0.2 ONLY** | BuildID: FEABC8D141EECCA5 

## How to install the mods (for Emulators)

> [!NOTE]
Check this [VIDEO GUIDE](https://youtu.be/ij5fLfaZAWc?si=kBf1FVzheZY5SMgz) to know how to download my mods **if the format is only .pchtxt**

Otherwise, **follow the next instructions**:

1. **Click on the folder of the mod that you want to use**

Then **Click on the .zip file name**. Finally **click on View Raw** to start the download.

2. Now open your emulator (Yuzu or Ryujinx). Right click on the game and Open Mod Data Location (for Yuzu)/Open Mods Directory (for Ryujinx).

3. Extract/Unzip the .zip file into this directory.

Your path should be something like this: `60FPS\exefs\1.0.1.pchtxt`

## About reuploading the mods

**You don't have permission to reupload my mods to external sites** such as Mediafire or any other similar site.

**Also you don't have permission to reupload the mods adding shorten links with ads**.

**The mods are free**. I don't earn anything by making them. I don't use shorten links to earn pennies either.

> [!NOTE]
SERIOUSLY, JUST USE THE ORIGINAL LINKS

However if you want, you cant support me [here](https://ko-fi.com/stevenss). That's up to you.
