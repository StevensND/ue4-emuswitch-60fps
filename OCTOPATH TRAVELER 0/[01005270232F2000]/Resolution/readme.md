> [!NOTE]
The Default resolution on **Docked** it's **1280x720**.

It should be 1920x1080 but the game applies a screen percentage of 66.66 %. This drops the resolution to 1280x720.

Also if you use the 1080p mod that should be 720p on Handheld.

1440p should be 960p on Handheld. 2160p should be 1440p on Handheld ...

On emulators, you can check the actual resolution using [ReShade](https://reshade.me/#download)

After installing it, go to the Add-ons tab.
